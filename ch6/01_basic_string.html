<h1>A Simple Test of Your Basic String Processing Skills</h1>

<h2>Input and Output</h2>

<p>Input contains several lines that contain only alphabet characters [A-Za-z], digits [0-9], space, dash ('-'), and period ('.').<br>
The first input block ends with a line containing seven periods (".......").<br>
The dash character, if appears, will only appear at the end of a line.<br>
If there is a dash character at the end of a line, it means that the last word of that line is actually continued in the next line.<br>
The dash character will not appear in the line before (".......").<br>
There can be up to 30 characters per line and no more than 10 lines for this input block.</p>

<p>For this input block, output the input again but now <b>in one line</b> and <b>in lowercase form</b>.<br>
Then output three integers in one line to denote the number of digits, vowels, and consonants found in this input block.<br>
Then output two words (separated by a single space) in this input block that is lexicographically smallest and largest.<br>
Here, <b>word</b> is defined by consecutive alphabet(s) and/or digit(s) separated by either space(s), dot(s), or a newline.<br>
Finally, output either "0" or "1" in one line: "1" if the first input block contains substring "cs3233" (case insensitive); "0" otherwise.</p>

<p>After the line with seven periods ("......."), there will be one more line appearing in the input.<br>
This last line can be of any length.</p>

<p>For this last line, output three integers in one line to denote the number of character 's' (lower case), 'h' (lower case), and '7' in the last line.</p>

<p>This problem can be frustrating one if you keep getting WA...<br>
Thus, we have included the actual input/output data with very trivial modification.</p>

<pre>
I love CS3233 Competitive Pro-
gramming and AlGoRiThM. Of
course I love my wife Grace
Suryani very much too. Test
that there are thirty chars
m12345678901234567890123456789
......
hehehe the line above only
contains six . cannot stop...
.......
after the first input block... there will be one last line can be very long... I am going to type 77777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777 then a longgggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg ssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringgggggggggggggggggggggggg ssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringgggggggggggggggggggggggg ssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringgggggggggggggggggggggggg ssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringgggggggggggggggggggggggg ssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringgggggggggggggggggggggggg ssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringgggggggggggggggggggggggg ssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringgggggggggggggggggggggggg ssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringggggggggggggggggggggggggssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringggggggggggggggggggggggggssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringggggggggggggggggggggggggssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringggggggggggggggggggggggggssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringggggggggggggggggggggggggssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringggggggggggggggggggggggggssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringggggggggggggggggggggggggssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringggggggggggggggggggggggggssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringggggggggggggggggggggggggssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringggggggggggggggggggggggggssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringggggggggggggggggggggggggssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringggggggggggggggggggggggggssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringggggggggggggggggggggggggssssssssssssssssssssssssssstrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringgggggggggggggggggggggggg
